\chapter{The Large Hadron Collider and the CMS Detector}
\label{ch:detector}

In order to probe the most fundamental constituents of nature, accelerators ramp particles up to great energies and then collide them to probe particle interactions. Detectors situated at the collision point can measure the outgoing products from particle collisions, and physicists can study the interactions to measure SM parameters, determine particle properties, quantify interaction rates, or search for new particles and processes.

The Large Hadron Collider is the most powerful particle accelerator ever constructed, and collides protons at a rate of nearly one billion times per second at a record energy of 13 Teraelectronvolts. The Compact Muon Solenoid is one of the all-purpose physics detectors that monitors the products of proton-proton collisions delivered by the LHC. Together with the ATLAS detector (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS), the CMS detector is responsible for collecting data to measure a wide range of physics phenomena.

This work would not have been possible without all the members of the CMS collaboration, whose support made it possible to produce the figures and tables in this chapter.
