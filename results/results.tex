\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}
The techniques described in this analysis are applied to 35.9\fbinv of proton-proton collision data gathered at the LHC and recorded by the CMS detector. Observed yields in each signal region are further interpreted in the context of simplified SUSY models to establish new limits on the masses of hypothesized BSM particles.

This chapter makes use of figures and tables from the \mttwo paper and internal analysis note to illustrate the analysis design, methodology, and results. This work was made possible by contributions from the rest of the Surf \& Turf group, our collaborators at ETH Zurich, and the many other CMS members in the SUSY group and beyond.
